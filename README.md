# HTML5 Game
This project has been developed to evaluate the user of web browser games. 
The aim of the game is to survive until the game round ends. Currently, the game is only physically playable via a keyboard. 

The game will run on devices and different browsers, but controls will not work without a keyboard.

## Installation
 
To run the client side of the game, you need to have npm installed. The server is currently hosted on Heroku, so you will not need to use this folder.

You can download it here:
https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

The IDE used to develop this game and run it is: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Running instructions:
Create a new terminal and navigate into the project. 

```bash
# make sure you are in the client folder
cd client

# install dependencies
npm install

# run client side
npm run serve
```

Once running, the client will be accessible on your local network and localhost. This will show up in the terminal.
